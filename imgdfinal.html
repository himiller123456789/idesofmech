The year is 3048. Led by a legion of robots programmed to mimic legendary conquerors of history, highly advanced machines have taken over the world and human progress has come to a standstill. However, there is still a glimmer of hope. You, one of the last survivors of the Anti-Automaton Army, have procured a spot in the Senate. Now, you must find the robot who calls himself Julius Caesartron and destroy him on the steps of the Senate before the robots completely take over.
