<b>The Ides of Mech: Diary</b>

<br><br><br>

  <b>Thursday, September 20:</b> Items for the final game were chosen. Our group was last to pick and grabbed a deck of cards, glass gaming stones, and zombie figures.

<br><br><br>

<b>Sunday, September 23:</b> Game lore was consolidated into a brief paragraph giving the player an idea of the world they are playing in. Some historical research was done to connect the unfamiliar sci-fi setting with the real world.

<br><br><br>

<b>Monday, September 24:</b> Spent an hour in class discussing game ideas. Agreed to make a completely different game from the other games we’ve made and decided on a social deduction game. The game had lore previously written because it couldn’t be used in any of our other games. Rules came naturally. The idea to use a hit-points system was established.

<br><br><br>

<b>Wednesday, September 26:</b> Started our group meeting at 2 and it lasted for only an hour. The game is inspired by Werewolf and Secret Hitler, borrowing ideas of how to balance the game and how different roles should act. When making the rules, we only used the deck of cards and the gaming marbles. It was really clear that we wouldn’t need the zombie figures. Hit-points were changed to votes.

<br><br><br>

<b>Thursday, September 27: </b>During class, we played another groups game and became their first round of play testers. As we played, we took notes on their game, like how they worded their game and how the rules were set up. As an assignment, we wrote constructive feedback and reviews to help them improve their game. All of this was also done with our game.

<br><br><br>

<b>Monday, October 1:</b> In class, we discussed the different reviews that we got from our play testers. We decided to make a list of different complaints and possible improvements that people had discussed in their reviews to possibly add to our game and decided to meet up later in the week to revise our game.

<br><br><br>

<b>Wednesday, October 3:</b> Group got together to revise old rules. Decided to change the wording in some parts. Biggest change were the different win conditions that were added. Since killing Caesartron is so important in the lore of the game, we adding that into our win condition. So, the red team doesn’t just win if they end up killing a black card. They must discover who Caesartron is and kill him in order to win. Just killing Caesar’s bodyguards are not good enough. After reading this comment about the game, we decided to implement it into our game. It’s sort of like the Minion in Werewolf. If they die, they bad guys still end up winning.

<br><br><br>

<b>Thursday, October 4:</b> We played another game in class and were the second round of play testers for a group. This means that there was also another round of play testers for our game.
