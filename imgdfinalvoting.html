Players use the marbles gotten through the attack phase to vote for other players by placing marbles in front of them. The player with the least amount of votes doesn’t get to vote in this final round. If there is a 2 way tie, neither of these players vote. If there is a 3+ tie, this rule doesn’t come into play.
The player with the most amount of votes only gets to use half of their pieces to vote, rounded up (if a tie through any amount of players, this rule still stands). 

<br>
Every other player gets to use all of their white marbles that they’ve collected to vote on people. These can be divided in any way. If a player ends up with 3 marbles, they can all be used to vote one person, or they can be divide between 2 players, with one being on one player and 2 on the other, and so on. 
<br><br>
<b>Win Conditions:</b>Once everyone has placed their vote, the player with the most amount of votes dies and they reveal their player role. Win conditions:<br>
If Caesar (Joker) is killed, the humans win and the robots lose<br>
If a robot (black card) is killed, Caesar/the robots win and the humans lose<br>
If a human (red card) is killed, Caesar/the robots win and the humans lose<br><br>

<b>Special Winning Conditions:</b>
If two people are voted in the end to be killed and they are both a different color, the black team wins unless the black card chosen is Caesar.<br>
If there are no black cards in play (they are all in the middle), the group must decide to use their votes to vote for the middle cards. Note that you are not voting for a specific card in the middle, you are just throwing your votes away so that you don’t kill a fellow human. If any player gets a vote, however, and all players end up being red, the red team loses.
