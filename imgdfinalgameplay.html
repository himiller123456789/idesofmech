<b> The game is split into three main phases- first, discussion, then attacking, then a final discussion and voting phase. </b>

<br><br>

<b>First Discussion Phase:</b> In this phase, everyone should talk about their roles and what they did. During this phase, try and discover who is on which side. Black cards are encouraged to lie about who they are to throw the red team off their trail.

<br> <br>

<b>Attacking Phase:</b> Next, you will start battling for votes in the Senate. Choose a player to go first (possibly by playing a deadly game of Rock-Paper-Scissors). The player who is chosen to go first or who wins Rock-Paper-Scissors then chooses two people (that could include themselves) to face off. That player picks up the first four cards of the remaining deck of cards. They look at the top four cards and choose two cards for one player and two cards for the other. Those two players then face off. They choose one card to play. If:
<br>
2 red cards are played: both players lose a vote <br>
1 red and 1 black are played: No one loses a vote, but the player who played the red gains a vote<br>
2 black cards are played: nothing happens<br>
As this round goes on, players will begin to gain and lose votes. Keep track of how many each player has and pay attention to any potential clues. Be aware of who is choosing who to battle and we encourage discussion during this phase.

<br><br>

<b>Second Discussion Phase:</b> After each player has chosen people to battle twice, the final discussion begins. (For a longer game, add more battle rounds) This is the last ditch effort to find out who Caesartron and the other robots are and to possibly reveal critical information. When everyone is satisfied with the discussion, move on to the voting phase (explained in the voting phase page).
