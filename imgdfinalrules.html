“Everyone, heads down. Queen of Hearts, heads up. Look at one of the face down cards in the middle. If you see the Joker, you are now Caesartron. If you don’t, look at another card in the middle. If you see the Joker, you are now Caesartron, if not, nothing happens. Heads Down. Joker, stick out your thumb. Black cards, heads up. Look up and see who Caesartron is. If you are the only black card to look up and don’t see a thumb, you are now Caesartron. If there are 2 of you and no Caesartron, the King of Spades becomes Caesartron. Everyone, heads down. Joker, thumb down. King of Diamond, heads up. Switch 2 player cards without looking at them. You can also switch player cards with middle cards, but you can only switch a total of 2 cards. Heads down. Queen of Diamonds, heads up. Look at one players card, which can include yourself. Heads down. Everyone, heads up.”
