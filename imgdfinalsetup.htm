Each player starts off with 2 white gaming pieces to represent votes for the final discussion. With 5 players, use 8 face cards to represent roles. Of those 8 cards, 3 of them are robots. Take out one Joker, the King and the Jack of Spades. Next, take out the King, Queen, and Jack of Hearts as well as the King and Queen of Diamonds. These are the humans. Place the other cards of the deck to the side, they will be used later.

To start, mix the 8 role cards and deal them out to each player face down. Place the 3 extra face cards face down in the middle of the table in a row. Your cards should be in front of you so that they are easily accessible. These cards represent your roles.
Joker: Julius Caesartron
King of Spades: Head Bodyguard
Jack of Spades: Bodyguard 
Queen of Hearts: the Oracle
King of Diamonds: the Rogue
Queen of Diamonds: the Mechanic
The King and Jack of Hearts: fellow humans

At the beginning of the game, nominate one player to read the 'script' page. They must be able to read it, but also follow along with what it says. They have to read the rules, but also not see what is going on with everyone else. Tip: keep the rules in front of your face so you can’t see when people are lifting their heads, but you can easily lower the paper and perform your role if necessary. When finished, move on to the 'playing the game' section.
